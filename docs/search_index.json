[["index.html", "Visualization for Data Science with R Proposal Why read this book Structure of the book Software information and conventions", " Visualization for Data Science with R Angela M. Zoss, Ph.D. 2022-01-25 Proposal Note: This book is a work in progress, with a full draft expected in April of 2022. This book combines instruction on writing R code with building basic graphic design skills in a way that is unusual in data science literature. The book will guide readers through a series of projects, each designed to cover both how visualizations work in R and how visualizations can be designed to have the greatest impact. Far more than a “do this, then this” checklist, this book will focus on building understanding, confidence, and the ability to transfer skills to other tools and design contexts. It will avoid technical jargon that our target audience is unlikely to have encountered before. To accommodate learners who don’t have time to work through an entire book, each chapter will operate independently, covering a specific set of tasks that all make sense together as part of a visualization project. For those who would like extra practice, there will be several types of hands-on exercises, from those that are entirely prescribed to those that allow readers to apply new techniques to problems in their own areas. The book will have solutions (in the form of completed code and sample output) for all exercises. While not a textbook, the book will also include a brief teacher’s guide for courses that might want to use one or more chapters to structure lessons in a course. The book will also have a website, including links to Open Access content, solutions, and related resources like video tutorials. The target audience of this book would be professionals who are having to learn data science techniques on the job, likely at an under-resourced organization or company. These newly minted data professionals may feel comfortable in Excel but have only just started to learn R for processing data. They have never used a programming language to build a visualization before, and even creating charts in Excel has often been a frustrating and mystifying process. They appreciate that R is freely available and are able to get started on a data science project, but the idea of creating publication-quality visualizations using only code is daunting. Increasingly, programs of study with a focus on preparing students for professional careers in under-resourced fields, like public policy and even management, include courses on data analysis and communication using freely available software. This book, while not a textbook, could easily be used for a semester-long course, titled something like “Practical data visualization for the modern workforce.” A chapter could be covered each week, and larger projects could help learners synthesize chapters into a complete set of analyses and communication materials.

One of the first things you should do to improve your skills creating visualizations is to become familiar with the kinds of visualizations that are possible and the different features of each. Effective visualization design relies on a solid understanding of how data properties, visualization types, and audience characteristics interact to help people make sense of a visualization. In this chapter, we’ll look at a series of common visualization types, and we’ll break down how each is meant to be read. Understanding these basic visualization types will create a solid foundation for communicating your data science work to a broad audience. 1.1 Visualization components As we discuss different visualizations, we will also be talking about different components within the visualizations. In figure 1.1 below, the major components of the visualization are labeled: the main title, the subtitle, the x axis title, the y axis title, the panel, the horizontal and vertical gridlines, and the axis labels and tick marks for both axes. Almost all of the visualizations we cover in this book will use these basic components. FIGURE 1.1: Visualization components, labeled. In this set of basic visualization components, we see two components labeled as an axis. These axes are called the x and y axes, and they always appear in these positions: the x axis always goes left to right, and the y axis always goes up and down. 1.2 Bar Chart The bar chart is possibly the most common type of visualization. In this type of visualization, the basic shape being used to represent data values is a rectangle. In a traditional bar chart, each rectangle (or bar) has exactly the same width, and the height of the bar is representative of some data value. To create a simple bar chart, the data set should have one column that contains textual data and one column that contains numerical data. (Another common way to create a bar chart is to start with one textual data column and count each instance of each text value to create the numerical column.) FIGURE 1.2: A sample bar chart. In the sample bar chart above, we see a classic style of bar chart where each bar has the same width and the heights are proportionate to a data value. Each bar has a starting value of zero on the y axis. For data values that are positive, the bar travels upward from zero and stops at the correct data value. For data values that are negative, the bar travels downward from zero and stops at the correct data value. The x axis title and labels appear at the bottom of the panel, below the lowest data values. When reading this visualization, we are comparing the lengths of bars in order to understand patterns within the numerical data values from our data set. The power of the bar chart lies in how precisely we can detect differences in the lengths of bars. This is something that people naturally do quite well. Bar charts are especially effective if the bars that have small differences in lengths appear close to each other. In the above chart, this is accomplished by arranging the bars so they appear with the highest data values on the left and the lowest data values on the right. For stylistic reasons, bar charts may also appear with the bars oriented horizontally instead of vertically. In that case, each bar will have the same height, and the widths of the bars will vary based on the data values. The text (or categorical) axis will then be the y axis, and the numerical axis will be the x axis.
