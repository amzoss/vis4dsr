Data set names are preceded with Raw_Data
		
Data Set	Column Name	Description
Experiment	coral_id	ID numbers for individual coral colonies tracked during the experiment
Experiment	circumf_1	Circumference of first-axis of the coral colony obtained with a measuring tape (cm)
Experiment	circumf_2	Circumference of second-axis of the coral colony obtained with a measuring tape (cm)
Experiment	coral_surfarea	"Surface area (cm2) of coral colonies, calculated from two circumference measurements averaged together and the equation for surface area of half a sphere (SA = π × d²); no data obtained for coral #65"
Experiment	temp_avg	"Average temperatures experienced by individual corals from July 1-30, 2014; data obtained from Hobo Pendant Data Loggers placed next to corals"
Experiment	treatment	"Three treatments used in the experiment: full removals (0 snails), average density (5 snails), high density (10 snails)"
Experiment	snails_exp	"Average snail densities experienced by individual corals during the experiment, obtained from weekly monitoring of snail densities"
Experiment	tissue_loss	"Surface area of coral tissue lost due to snail predation during the experiment; Coral #44 experienced some disease signs, was removed from tissue loss analysis"
Experiment	snails_bleaching	Density of snails on corals when bleaching data were obtained in October 2014 (snail density treatments were not maintained after mid-August 2014)
Experiment	bleaching	"Percent tissue per coral colony that was bleached, indicated by completely white coral skeleton without the presence of algal overgrowth"
Experiment	mort_postbleach	Percent tissue per coral colony that was dead (indicated by algal overgrowth) in November 2014 after coral bleaching event ended
		
Survey	site	Reef site where snail presence surveys occurred
Survey	coral_species	Coral species surveyed
Survey	total_snails	Total number of snails counted for that coral species in that reef site
Survey	total_colonies	Total number of coral colonies surveyed for that species in that reef site
Survey	colonies_w_snails	Total number of coral colonies of that species found with snail predation
Survey	prop_w_snails	Proportion of all colonies of that species surveyed found with snail predation
Survey	sn_per_coral_sn	Number of snails per coral colony of that species out of all colonies found with snails
Survey	sn_per_coral_all	Number of snails per coral colony out of all colonies surveyed of that species
