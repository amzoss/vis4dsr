#Conch Reef,SPA/ No-take,Upper Keys,N 24 57.110, W 80 27.564
#Coffins Patch,SPA/ No-take,Middle Keys,N 24 41.400, W 80 57.850

#American Shoals,Fishing allowed,Lower Keys,N 24 31.568, W 81 31.383

# but all of the experiment data comes from multiple colonies in one reef.
# p. 46 of thesis:

# "This experiment was conducted at Pickles Reef in Key Largo, Florida,
# USA from mid-June to mid-August 2014. Within the experimental site, I selected 
# 30 similarly-sized colonies (~159.1 Â± 15.5 cm 2 surface area) that were already 
# harboring C. abbreviata."
